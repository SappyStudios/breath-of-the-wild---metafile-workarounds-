# breath-of-the-wild---metafile-workarounds-
meta.xml work arounds for getting your copy to work you can send in your meta.xml file. what seemed impossible.. we can fix! (.WUD and .WUX workarounds)

first you upload your zip/rar/7z here with the files from your setup (if that certain person already has the base game) dont upload the base only the 1.5.0 (v208) update meta.xml 

for this to work with someone who already setup up cemu for botw sends in their meta.xml 

after that the user that doesnt or has not obtained their meta file can come here and and without stress then drop the meta.xml into the same folder as the update data that has not got one metafile for use and it will be fixed with the one collected here!
